# bigsoundaichatroom-
this is developed by me and sundayScoop, in a day in age where text message often creates misunderstanding. Why not add an ai agent that intentionally misinterprets your intention before presenting it to the group chat? There are a million way you can set your tone, and chatgpt will make sure to get your point delivered loud and clear.

3 parts of the project

1. Open AI Api - engage with chatgpt via a node moudlue and dicuss your intention to use it in prompt.js and client.js
2. websocket server in index.js
3. react app that act as the chatroom ui
