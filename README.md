this is developed by me and sundayScoop, in a day in age where text message often creates misunderstanding. Why not add an ai agent that intentionally misinterprets your intention before presenting it to the group chat? There are a million way you can set your tone, and chatgpt will make sure to get your point delivered loud and clear.
